#Assignment D


##Project Description:

### When creating my project I wanted to create something  isolated. I didn't want to follow the conventions of most the other artist I saw how used monochromatic colors so I add color into it to create a sense of irony. Isolation is usually expressed as cold and desolate but I used had the background changed color as well the object. I used distance as a way to create the feel of isolation. In my first sketch used peasy cam to view the object from a different angle. I then took out the peasy cam and then moved to the "default" view over the object. I feel this creates a sense of discorvey as if the view happened to come across this lone object. After this my second object, which uses noise to create random nets around the central form the of object. The central form is  created by use tangents which creates a DNA shape. When you come across an object you first examine the objects from but the second step is to try and define what is the object. You form an idea around the what characteristics makes the object distinct. So I felt DNA was symbolised that.
