# 	Why do I like it?
### 	I like his work because it’s very retro and lo-fi. I really like the choice of colors and it looks like a pixilated wind. His other work is reminiscent of television static. In this piece it’s as if the harshness of the static has becoming soothing and effervescent. Instead of stark black and white you get a rainbow of colors. Instead of a random flashes of white and black he you get a soothing, flowing, patterns moving underneath the static.

# 	How is it done?
### 	I think he’s overlaying different images and playing with the transparency of those images. He is also pixelating the images creating the look of squares. My patch works creating growing squares and changing the background colors to simulating the pixilated look. I then added the glitch library into the sketch to add even more pixilation.
